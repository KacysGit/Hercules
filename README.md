### General Information ###
The Hercules App is a mobile application developed using React Native and Visual Studio Code. 
It serves as a comprehensive fitness and wellness tool, allowing users to track their workouts, store workout data, visualize their progress, 
monitor nutrition and food intake, and engage in mindfulness activities. This app aims to make fitness and wellness management more convenient and accessible.

## Technologies ##
* React.Native - prebuild
* Javascript - prebuild
* CSS - prebuild
* Firebase - prebuild

### What problem does it (intend to) solve? ###
The Hercules App addresses the need for individuals to have a single platform for tracking their fitness progress, 
managing their nutrition, and practicing mindfulness. It simplifies the process of managing one's health and fitness goals by providing a consolidated solution.

### What is the purpose of your project? ###
The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly and feature-rich workout and wellness app that enables users to:

- Track workouts throughout the day, week, and month.
- Store workout data for future reference.
- Graph their progress for each workout, including rep and weight ratios.
- Monitor nutrition and food intake with analytics for food nutrition.
- Engage in mindfulness activities such as meditation and water intake tracking.

### Why did you undertake it? ###
We undertook this project to empower individuals to take control of their health and fitness goals by providing them with a versatile tool 
that combines workout tracking, nutrition monitoring, and mindfulness practices.

### Features ###
List of ready features:
- Track workouts throughout the day, week, and month.
- Store workout data for future reference.
- Graphical representation of workout progress, including rep and weight ratios.
- Nutrition tracking with analytics for food nutrition.
- Mindfulness section for tracking meditation and water intake.

### Project Status ###
Project is: In progress

### Room for Improvement ###
Areas for improvement:
- Integration with wearable fitness devices.
- Enhanced social sharing features.
- Improved user interface and user experience.

### To do: ###
- Create UI for munchies and mind screens
- Create FireBase database to store workouts/nutrution.
- Integrate existing public api for nutritional facts.
- Fix the date to be able to view workouts from a specific day (stored in firebase).


### Acknowledgements ###

### Team Meeting Times ###
Sundays from 4:00-5:00pm

### Road Blocks ###
Kacy was supposed to create the graph and the graph button for the app. However, in order
to see the changes she is making, she needed to use Expo to see the app. Kacy hit a 
road block at this point and after spending several hours of following ChatGPT's instructions
and her teammates' instructions, she was not able to resolve the errors she was getting.
Without being able to see if her code is work, she could not continue with the graphs.
The team has pivoted and will be focusing on resolving roadblocks for the rest of this sprint
and has already started discussing tasks for the next sprint to pick up what we couldn't complete
this time. Dr. Lehr instructed Kacy to update her tasks on Jira so they show the work completed 
and intended to complete rather than the work that was inaccessible due to the road block.

Additionally, Kacy offered to help Aaron resolve the merge conflicts he was experiencing
because he had no prior experience resolving them.

### Assisting Teammates ###
Kacy Metcalf is the only team member with experience using GitKraken so she spent several hours helping her 
teammates resolve errors with it and to adjust to the GitKraken user interface. Kacy helped Kaleb who was
having an error whenever he would try to checkout a different branch or delete the branch he was on.
After a lot of extensive trouble shooting, it turned out that the computer needed to be restarted and that
it should have been working to begin with. 
Aaron assisted multiple team members with Expo Go and helped resolve
some debugging issues associated to others code

### Kaleb Perez Sprint 1 ###

In the development of the hercules application, I successfully integrated a bottom navigation bar. This navigation bar serves as a central navigational tool, directing users to different sections of the application. Key features I implemented was the "Workout", "Mind", and "Munchies" screens. On the workout screen, I added functionality so that users can interact with and create dynamically generated buttons that represent different workout "splits". I designed a system where users can add new splits through a modal dialog. After entering the desired split name, a corresponding button is created on the Workout screen. I also set up the main file tree and starting files including all of the files to run the code. I also did the research to figure out how to set up expo and run the app. I spent time with each teamate helping them run it.

### Aaron Parks Sprint 1 ###
In the developement of the Hercules app, I was tasked with 3 main features of the workout app. Such as: Creating the Date above the workouts, adding forward and back buttons on the date to choose a close date, and 
creating a calendar drop down to choose a date to view workouts. 
Also aided Kaleb in debugging, and helped other group members set up Expo Go.
