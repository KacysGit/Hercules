Found difference in types of databases, deciding on firestore database as we will have more
hierarchial data that is less on the complexity scale.

Link to useful docs to know how to do different functions and example codes:

After assignment10 I have a better understanding on how to use firebase to create a working webpage that stays open.

Firebase is free to use and scales with users/data, one passes a certain point will need to start to pay, but I doubt we will reach that point.

In firebase on different sections (eg. Firestore database) you can set security limitations 
to who can read or write to the data, will be testing to see if you can limit certain words/data that is uploaded (eg. restricting innapropriate words).

You can limit access to individuals information by giving users a uniqe UID and when logged in only that UID can access their own private information (can add extra security but for now this will suffice)

Found a video explaining on how to pull data into firebase database:

Using javascript read/write function you can create a/n account and when logged in pull the users information, and have to where only the user can edit their own information.
(more information found out will be added here)
