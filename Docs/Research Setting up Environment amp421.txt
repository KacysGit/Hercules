Set up environment for React Native:


Go to top level directory:
npm install 
install node
expo init -g 

Go to project level directory:
expo start 
Scan QR code that is provided when you ran the previous command.

Had problems getting the Expo Go app working with the QR code provided here. Communicated with GPT to see what changes or commands I can run to fix the issue.
Cannot be using LAN (disconnected my LAN from my computer)
Connected to same WIFI on mobile device and computer 

Fixed the issue by running the following commands:
expo start -c
ctrl c (stop)
expo start --tunnel (create a tunnel using port 80 vs port 190)

Now the app is working and I can see current changes after I save in VS code on my mobile device via the Expo Go App.
