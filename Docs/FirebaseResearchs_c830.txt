# Purpose
The purpose of this research is to familiarize myself with Firebase's functionality and how it stores data.

# Goals:
Upon completion of my research, I hope to be able to
- Launch a Firebase webpage
- Understand Firestore data
- Create a data structure compatible with Firestore

# Research
Firebase
    Creating a Firebase project:
    - npm install firebase-tools -g   (adds command line Firebase tools)
    - Create project from Firebase console
    - In terminal, firebase init
    - firebase serve  -  local testing
    - firebase deploy  -  live!

    Files
    firebase.rc contains project identification
    firebase.json contains hosting roles

    User Authentication:
    googleLogin() allows users to log in with Google account
    This code prevents button from being clicked before page has loaded, preventing issues:
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
            const app = firebase.app()
            console.log(app)
        });
    User authentication methods can modified in console > Authentication
        const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
        firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(provider)
    

Firestore
- Works in conjunction with Firebase and Google Cloud
- Stores documents in hierarchy (collections)
- Connects directly to Firebase app to manage data
- NEAR realtime

Enable Firestore on Firebase console
Each collection is a SPECIFIC data type
Each document has:
    a path: ex. /exercises/row
    fields: custom variables with set types
Add documents with import addDocs, document.querySelector('.add'), addDoc(collection, { variable1, variable2, etc. })
