I am using code I have made in the past as refrence and to help understand how I used to create webpages to login.

I have found a link to a tutorial on how to create a login form:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_login_form.asp

Using both examples along with example code for firebase: 
https://www.javatpoint.com/firebase-read-and-write-in-firestore
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write?hl=en&authuser=0

I am confident in creating a login page using a email and password that will let users access public information yet not other users information.

Using html "HREF" if a succesful login has occured I can send user information to second page or depending on route we build close login div and open the starting page div with access to the logged in users information.

CSS is still a little weak for me and ahrd to understand, but I have the basics.

(more information to be added here)
