**Setting Up Expo with React Native in VS Code**


1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
   - This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) alongside.

2. **Install Expo CLI**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and enter:
     ```
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```

3. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   - Download and install VS Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

4. **Install Extensions for VS Code**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to Extensions (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - Search for and install the following extensions:
     - React Native Tools: Provides debugging, IntelliSense, and other tools for React Native.
     - ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets: Provides code snippets.

5. **Set Up a New Expo Project**:
   - In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want your project and enter:
     ```
     expo init MyNewExpoProject
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to choose a template.
   - Once completed, navigate into your project directory:
     ```
     cd MyNewExpoProject
     ```

6. **Open the Project in VS Code**:
   - In your terminal or command prompt, while inside the project directory, enter:
     ```
     code .
     ```

7. **Running the App with Expo**:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, ensure you are in the project directory and enter:
     ```
     expo start
     ```
   - This will open a new browser window with a QR code. You can scan this QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to see your app live.

   - Type "React Native" and select the relevant options for debugging.

9. **Additional Configurations and Tips**:
   - Customize your React Native development experience through the settings in VS Code. This includes enabling auto-save, adjusting linting rules, etc.
   - Consider integrating ESLint or Prettier for consistent code formatting and linting.
   - Regularly check for updates in Expo, React Native, and the extensions to stay updated with the latest features and fixes.
