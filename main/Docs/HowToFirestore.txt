How to find a user's folder:

db.collection("users").doc("name@xxx.com").get().then(function (doc) {
    if (doc && doc.exists) {
        var data = doc.data();
        // saves the data to 'name'
        firestore.collection("users").doc("name").set(data).then({
            // deletes the old document
            firestore.collection("users").doc("name@xxx.com").delete();
        });
    }
});


To reference a specific document:
    DocumentReference documentRef = db.Document("userData/alovelace");
    In this example, "userData" is a collection (folder) and "alovelace" is also a collection(folder)
    with subcollections and documents inside of it that can be accessed.

READING DOCUMENTS:
    
const db = getFirestore(app);      must be declared before referencing Firestore docs or collections
It gets our Firestore info - then collections can be referenced by:

const docRef = doc(db, "user1", "muscles", "Bench Press");    where db has been declared as Firestore reference, "user1" is a collection for a particular user, 
                                                              "muscles" is a subcollection within "user1," and "Bench Press" is a document within the "muscles" subcollection
const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);      now docSnap is a reference to the collection "muscles" for "user1." must use "await" to and "if docSnap.exists()" to prevent errors.
                                           docRef and docSnap can use other names, such as exerciseFolderReference or userReference
if (docSnap.exists()) {
  console.log("Document data:", docSnap.data());    
} else {
  // docSnap.data() will be undefined in this case
  console.log("No such document!");
}


WRITING OR CHANGING DOCS:

// if this document doesn't already exist, it will create it
// if it does exist, it will be completely overwritten: make sure to specify all values,
// even if only one is being changed
await setDoc(doc(db, "user1", "muscles", "Deadlift"), {
  weight: 160,
  reps: 6,
  sets: 3,
  split: "Back",
});

DELETING DOCUMENTS:

await deleteDoc(doc(db, "user1"));      // deletes all of user1's data

await deleteDoc(doc(db, "user1", "muscles", "Bench Press));      // deletes user1's copy of "Bench Press"
